**Securing Your AWS Environment: Our Cloud Security Services**

**Date:** May 1, 2025

**Prepared For:** \[Client Name/Prospective Client\]

**Introduction**

Migrating to and operating within Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers incredible flexibility, scalability, and innovation. However, securing your cloud environment is paramount and operates under a shared responsibility model. While AWS secures the underlying infrastructure, *you* are responsible for securing *what you run in the cloud*. This includes proper configuration, access control, data protection, and application security.

Navigating the complexities of AWS security requires specialized expertise. Misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, or architectural weaknesses can expose your organization to significant risks, including data breaches, service disruptions, compliance violations, and reputational damage.

At \[Your Company Name\], we specialize in AWS security. Our team of certified professionals possesses deep expertise in the AWS ecosystem and cybersecurity best practices. We offer a suite of services designed to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate security risks within your AWS environment. This document provides an overview of our core AWS security services: Security Configuration Review, Penetration Testing, and Threat Modeling.

**Our AWS Security Services**

We offer the following specialized services to enhance your AWS security posture:

1. **AWS Security Configuration Review:** A foundational assessment to identify misconfigurations and deviations from security best practices across your AWS services.  
2. **AWS Penetration Testing:** Simulating real-world attacks to uncover exploitable vulnerabilities and validate the effectiveness of your security controls.  
3. **AWS Threat Modeling:** A proactive analysis to identify and prioritize potential threats and security flaws in your application architecture and AWS environment, ideally during the design phase or for critical existing systems.

**1\. AWS Security Configuration Review**

* **What it is:** A comprehensive assessment of your AWS account(s) and service configurations against established security benchmarks (like CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark, AWS Well-Architected Framework Security Pillar) and industry best practices.  
* **Why it's important:** Misconfigurations are one of the leading causes of cloud security incidents. This review identifies gaps in your security posture, helps enforce the principle of least privilege, ensures proper logging and monitoring are in place, and validates adherence to compliance requirements.  
* **What We Do (Technical Approach):**  
  * **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Review users, groups, roles, policies (managed and inline), password policies, MFA enforcement, access key usage and rotation, cross-account access, and identity federation setups.  
  * **Networking (VPC):** Assess Security Group rules (ingress/egress), Network Access Control Lists (NACLs), VPC peering connections, VPN/Direct Connect configurations, VPC endpoints (Interface and Gateway), subnet routing, and Network Firewall configurations.  
  * **Compute (EC2, Lambda, Containers):** Examine EC2 instance security (AMIs, security groups, patching strategy linkage, metadata service access), Lambda function permissions and execution roles, ECS/EKS cluster security configurations, and container image security practices.  
  * **Storage (S3, EBS):** Review S3 bucket policies, Access Control Lists (ACLs), public access settings, encryption (at rest and in transit), versioning, logging, and EBS volume encryption.  
  * **Databases (RDS, DynamoDB, etc.):** Assess database instance security groups, encryption settings, access controls, backup and snapshot security, parameter group security settings, and IAM database authentication.  
  * **Logging, Monitoring & Alerting:** Evaluate CloudTrail configuration (multi-region, log file validation, integration with CloudWatch), CloudWatch Logs setup, GuardDuty findings and configurations, AWS Config rules and conformance packs, Security Hub integration, and alerting mechanisms.  
  * **Secrets Management & Encryption (KMS, Secrets Manager):** Review Key Management Service (KMS) key policies, usage, and rotation; assess Secrets Manager configuration and secret rotation practices.  
  * **Other Services:** Depending on your usage, review configurations for services like CloudFront, Route 53, API Gateway, SES/SQS/SNS security, etc.  
* **Deliverables:** A detailed report outlining:  
  * Findings categorized by risk level (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational).  
  * Specific misconfigurations or weaknesses identified.  
  * Potential impact of each finding.  
  * Clear, actionable recommendations for remediation, including specific configuration changes or architectural adjustments.

**2\. AWS Penetration Testing**

* **What it is:** A controlled, ethical attack simulation targeting your AWS environment and applications hosted within it. We mimic the techniques used by real-world attackers to identify exploitable vulnerabilities.  
* **Why it's important:** Configuration reviews identify *potential* weaknesses; penetration testing validates if those weaknesses (or others) can be *exploited* to compromise systems, access data, or disrupt services. It provides a realistic assessment of your defenses and potential attack paths, often required for compliance standards (e.g., PCI DSS, SOC 2).  
* **What We Do (Technical Approach):**  
  * **Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about your AWS footprint (exposed services, domains, potential user information).  
  * **Vulnerability Scanning & Analysis:** Identifying potential weaknesses in exposed services (EC2 instances, web applications, APIs, S3 buckets, databases).  
  * **Exploitation:** Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities, such as:  
    * Web application vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10\) hosted on EC2/ECS/Lambda.  
    * Misconfigured S3 buckets (public access, weak policies).  
    * Insecure API Gateway configurations.  
    * Exploitable services running on EC2 instances.  
    * Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) targeting the EC2 metadata service.  
  * **Privilege Escalation:** Attempting to escalate privileges within the AWS environment, often targeting misconfigured IAM policies or roles.  
  * **Lateral Movement:** Attempting to move from a compromised resource to other resources within your VPC or AWS account.  
  * **Data Exfiltration:** Testing if sensitive data can be accessed and exfiltrated from services like S3, RDS, or DynamoDB.  
  * **Serverless & Container Testing:** Assessing security of Lambda functions (event injection, insecure code, permissions) and container environments (ECS/EKS vulnerabilities, insecure configurations).  
  * **Validation of Security Controls:** Testing the effectiveness of Security Groups, NACLs, WAF rules, GuardDuty detection, and CloudTrail logging in response to simulated attacks.  
  * *(Note: All testing is performed according to agreed-upon Rules of Engagement and adheres to AWS penetration testing policies.)*  
* **Deliverables:** A comprehensive report including:  
  * Executive summary of key findings and overall risk posture.  
  * Detailed description of identified vulnerabilities.  
  * Step-by-step reproduction instructions for exploited vulnerabilities.  
  * Evidence (screenshots, logs where appropriate).  
  * Assessment of the business impact of successful exploits.  
  * Prioritized recommendations for remediation.

**3\. AWS Threat Modeling**

* **What it is:** A structured, proactive process to identify potential threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors relevant to your specific application architecture and its interaction with AWS services. It focuses on understanding *how* an attacker might target your system.  
* **Why it's important:** Threat modeling helps integrate security considerations early in the design lifecycle ("shift left security"), preventing costly flaws later. It identifies design-level weaknesses that configuration reviews or standard pentests might miss, helps prioritize security efforts based on realistic threats, and fosters a security-aware development culture.  
* **What We Do (Technical Approach):**  
  * **System Decomposition:** Understanding the application architecture, data flows, trust boundaries, entry points, and key assets within the AWS environment. This often involves creating or reviewing data flow diagrams (DFDs).  
  * **Threat Identification:** Using structured methodologies (e.g., STRIDE: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to brainstorm potential1 threats applicable to each component and interaction point. We consider threats specific to the AWS services used (e.g., Lambda event injection, S3 bucket policy manipulation, IAM role assumption vulnerabilities, SSRF against EC2 metadata).  
  * **Vulnerability Analysis:** Identifying potential weaknesses or lack of controls that could allow identified threats to be realized.  
  * **Risk Assessment:** Prioritizing identified threats based on likelihood and potential impact.  
  * **Mitigation & Control Identification:** Recommending specific security controls, architectural changes, or configuration adjustments within AWS to mitigate the prioritized threats. This could include recommending specific IAM policies, Security Group configurations, encryption methods, logging requirements, input validation techniques, or alternative service choices.  
* **Deliverables:**  
  * Threat Model documentation (including diagrams, identified assets, trust boundaries).  
  * A prioritized list of potential threats and attack vectors.  
  * Analysis of potential vulnerabilities related to identified threats.  
  * Recommended security controls and architectural modifications to mitigate risks.
